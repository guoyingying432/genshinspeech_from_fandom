Download multilingual speech and text from https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki

The text is not totally correct. For example, in https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Baizhu/Voice-Overs, "Not my glasses..." is not the right text for the speech. So if you want to use the data to train TTS model. Maybe use whisper[https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main/whisper] to generate text can be better.
